# Rockfish Skills

A collection of [Claude Skills](https://claude.com/skills) for the [Rockfish](https://www.rockfish.ai/) SDK - a Python SDK for generating synthetic data. Install them into Claude Code (or another compatible agent) and it will reach for the right one when you ask it to generate synthetic data, inject time-series incidents, or analyze Snowflake tables.

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`generate-from-schema`](skills/generate-from-schema/) | Generate synthetic tabular / time-series data from a schema (columns, state machines, foreign keys, PII-like values). |
| [`inject-incidents`](skills/inject-incidents/) | Inject spikes, outages, ramps, and sustained shifts into a baseline time series, and build ground-truth test suites to evaluate analytics agents. |
| [`snowflake-analyst`](skills/snowflake-analyst/) | Explore and load Snowflake data like local CSVs - list, describe, sample, profile, query, and import - without dragging whole tables over the network. |
