Rockfish supports two operational data models. Choosing the right one is the first schema
decision, because it determines every column's `column_category_type` and whether the
entity needs a `Timestamp`. A third, specialized shape — [span trees](#span-trees-distributed-traces)
for OpenTelemetry telemetry — is produced by a dedicated generator rather than the column
pipeline; reach for it only when generating distributed traces.

## Time-series

Data collected over time. Each entity instance is a **session**: a collection of **events**
ordered by a **timestamp** column.

| Time-series column type | Description | Maps to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metadata | Values that describe the session and are constant across its events. | `ColumnCategoryType.METADATA` |
| Measurement | Values that change over time within the session, usually quantitative. | `ColumnCategoryType.MEASUREMENT` |
| Timestamp | When each event was collected. | `Entity.timestamp=Timestamp(column_name=...)` |
| Session key | Unique identifier per session. Optional. | A metadata column, usually `ID` or `UNIQUE` |

Examples: web analytics (page views per user), IoT sensor readings, stock prices.

### Worked example — financial transactions

| customer | age | gender | category | amount | fraud | timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C2222 | 25 | F | food | 70.84 | 1 | 2023-08-01 09:10:07 |
| C1111 | 40 | M | transportation | 35.13 | 0 | 2023-08-01 09:12:51 |
| C2222 | 25 | F | transportation | 28.26 | 0 | 2023-08-01 09:27:30 |
| C1111 | 40 | M | food | 64.99 | 0 | 2023-08-01 09:39:17 |

Each transaction is an event; each customer's transactions form a session. Two sessions here.

| Type | Columns | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metadata | `age`, `gender` | Describe the customer performing the transactions. |
| Measurement | `category`, `amount`, `fraud` | Describe each individual transaction. |
| Timestamp | `timestamp` | When the transaction happened. |
| Session key | `customer` | The customer's unique identifier. |

As a schema: a `transactions` entity with `cardinality` = number of customers,
`timestamp=Timestamp(column_name="timestamp")`, `customer`/`age`/`gender` as independent
metadata columns, and `category`/`amount`/`fraud` as stateful measurement columns
(`STATE_MACHINE` for a behavioral category sequence, `TIMESERIES` for a numeric amount).

## Tabular

Rows and columns with no temporal dimension. Each entity instance is a **record**, and
**all columns are metadata**.

Examples: customer profiles, product inventory, sales records.

| Age range | Sex | Reason for incident | Body Temperature | Heart Rate | SBP | DBP | Hypertension |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 60<70 | M | Slip | 97 | 80 | 140 | 90 | Yes |
| 30<40 | F | Loss of balance | 96 | 78 | 145 | 95 | Yes |

Each patient incident is a record; three records means three rows. As a schema: one entity,
`cardinality=3`, every column `INDEPENDENT` + `METADATA`, and **no** `Timestamp` — an entity
with a timestamp must have at least one measurement column, and vice versa.

## Choosing between them

The same raw data can be modeled either way; pick based on the downstream task. For a
netflow dataset:

- Predicting a per-flow `type` with an ML model → **tabular**: each flow is a record, all
  columns metadata, 6 flows = 6 records.
- Analyzing patterns over time → **time-series**: each flow is an event, each
  `(srcip, dstip, srcport, dstport, proto)` connection is a session, with `pkt`, `byt`,
  `type`, `td` as measurements and `ts` as the timestamp. No session key column exists in
  this data, which is fine — the session key is optional.

Note: a dataset with only one session (a single group of metadata values) is treated as
tabular, since there are no distinct sessions to learn from.

## Consequences for schema authoring

- **Tabular entity**: no `Timestamp`, all columns `METADATA`, `column_type` ∈
  `INDEPENDENT` / `DERIVED` / `FOREIGN_KEY`. Rows = `cardinality`.
- **Time-series entity**: `Timestamp` required, at least one `MEASUREMENT` column, which
  must be `STATEFUL` (`TIMESERIES` / `STATE_MACHINE`) or `DERIVED`. Row count depends on
  *which* stateful domain you used — a `Timestamp` puts the entity on the time grid, it does
  not mean every tick is filled:
    - **`TIMESERIES` only → dense.** One row per instance per tick, so
      rows = `cardinality × ticks`. A metric like CPU usage has a value at every moment.
    - **`STATE_MACHINE` → sparse.** Each session starts at a random tick and occupies
      consecutive ticks only until it reaches a terminal state, so
      rows ≈ `cardinality × mean walk length` — independent of how wide the window is.
      A 4-step session is 4 rows whether the window holds 5 ticks or 500. Applying
      `cardinality × ticks` here can overestimate by one or two orders of magnitude.
- **Metadata is generated once per instance**, before timestamp expansion, which is why a
  metadata column can never depend on a measurement column. The reverse is allowed: each
  metadata value is present on every row of its session.
- **A mixed schema is normal.** Reference/dimension entities (a device catalog, a customer
  list) are tabular; fact/event entities (readings, sessions, transactions) are time-series,
  and they link through `entity_relationships`.

## Span trees (distributed traces)

A specialized model for **OpenTelemetry telemetry**, produced by a dedicated generator
instead of the column pipeline. You describe a service **call graph** once and Rockfish
emits a correlated signal set — distributed-trace spans, per-service RED metrics, and logs
— reconciled by construction because the metrics and logs are aggregated/derived from the
same spans. Needs **rockfish ≥ 0.82.2**. Full field reference in
[`schema-reference.md`](schema-reference.md#opentelemetry-span-trees); a complete worked
schema in [`patterns.md`](patterns.md#walkthrough-opentelemetry-from-a-call-graph).

The shape is a small set of linked entities:

| Entity | Role | How it's generated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trace` (driver) | one row per request, keyed by a trace id | ordinary column pipeline (`cardinality` = number of requests) |
| `span` | the distributed-trace spans | `span_tree=SpanTreeParams(trace_entity="trace", call_graph=...)` |
| `span_metric` | per-service RED metrics in time buckets | `span_metrics=SpanMetricsParams(span_entity="span")` |
| `log_record` | INFO/ERROR logs correlated by trace/span id | `span_logs=SpanLogsParams(span_entity="span")` |

Unlike the two core models, a span-generator entity does **not** author its own columns:
it must declare exactly the generator's fixed `OUTPUT_COLUMNS` (all `METADATA`), and its
`cardinality` is ignored. Row counts come from the driver, not `cardinality`:

- **`span` rows ≈ trace rows × mean spans per trace.** One tree per `trace` row, and a
  request that touches N services yields on the order of 2N+ spans. Set `cardinality=1`.
- **`span_metric` rows ≈ services × time buckets** (`bucket_seconds`-wide over the window).
- **`log_record` rows ≈ inbound spans + failed spans.**

A planted `SpanIncident` (a time-bounded latency/error degradation of one service) is the
distributed-trace analog of a timeseries spike — it appears consistently across all three
signals, which is what makes the dataset useful for demos, alert tuning, and training.
