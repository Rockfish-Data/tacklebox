description: Generate synthetic datasets from a schema specification using the Rockfish SDK. Use when a user wants to create synthetic tabular or time-series data with specific structure — independent, stateful, or derived columns, state machines, timeseries with seasonality, entity relationships (foreign keys, composite keys, parent/child fan-out, self-references), or realistic PII-like values (names, emails, addresses, SSNs) via NamedEntityProvider. Trigger on phrases like "generate synthetic data", "fake data from a schema", "create a test dataset", "GenerateFromDataSchema", or mentions of entity/foreign-key/state-machine data.

# Generate from schema

Use `rockfish.actions.GenerateFromDataSchema` to produce synthetic datasets from a declarative schema. One `DataSchema` yields one dataset (PyArrow table) per `Entity`, with referential integrity, temporal patterns, and reproducible output.

## When to use this skill

Use when the user wants synthetic tabular or time-series data with:

- Specific column shapes — IDs, globally-unique keys, categoricals, statistical distributions, mixtures.
- Time-varying measurements (timeseries with seasonality/noise/spikes) or behavioral sequences (state machines).
- Computed columns — arithmetic, value mapping, running totals, cross-entity roll-ups, string templates.
- Cross-entity relationships — foreign keys, composite keys, count-driven fan-out, whales, hierarchies.
- Realistic PII-like values (names, emails, addresses, SSNs, cards) that carry no real customer data.

If the user wants to inject *incidents* (spikes, outages, ramps, sustained shifts) into an existing time-series dataset, use the `inject-incidents` skill instead.

## Concept

A schema is a tree. Every generated column is one of four **column types**, and each column is also either **metadata** (constant per entity instance) or **measurement** (varies per timestamp):

```
DataSchema(seed, scale_factor)
├── entities: list[Entity]            # name, cardinality, scale_with_factor
│   ├── columns: list[Column]         # name, data_type, column_type, column_category_type
│   │   ├── column_type = independent → domain=Domain(...)      # metadata only
│   │   ├── column_type = stateful    → domain=TIMESERIES|STATE_MACHINE  # measurement only
│   │   ├── column_type = derived     → derivation=Derivation(...)
│   │   └── column_type = foreign_key → no domain, no derivation  # metadata only
│   └── timestamp: Timestamp          # required iff the entity has measurement columns
├── entity_relationships: list[EntityRelationship]
└── global_timestamp: GlobalTimestamp  # required iff any entity has a timestamp
```

Generation order is automatic: independent → foreign keys → stateful → derived (in dependency order).

## How to use

1. Decide the data model first — **tabular** (all metadata, no timestamp) or **time-series** (metadata + measurement + timestamp). See [`reference/data-models.md`](reference/data-models.md).
2. Build the `DataSchema` from typed dataclasses (validated at construction — prefer these) or an equivalent JSON dict.
3. Wrap it in `ra.GenerateFromDataSchema.Config(schema=..., upload_datasets=True)`.
4. Add it to a `WorkflowBuilder` and start it, then `await workflow.wait(raise_on_failure=True)`. Note `builder.add()` returns `None`, so it cannot be chained.
5. Pull results back with `workflow.datasets()`.

```python
import asyncio

import rockfish as rf
import rockfish.actions as ra
from rockfish.actions.ent import DataSchema, Entity, Column, ColumnType, ColumnCategoryType, Domain, DomainType, IDParams

schema = DataSchema(
    entities=[
        Entity(
            name="users",
            cardinality=50,
            columns=[
                Column(
                    name="user_id",
                    data_type="string",
                    column_type=ColumnType.INDEPENDENT,
                    column_category_type=ColumnCategoryType.METADATA,
                    domain=Domain(type=DomainType.ID, params=IDParams(template_str="USER_{id}")),
                ),
            ],
        )
    ],
    seed=42,  # makes the whole run reproducible
)

generate = ra.GenerateFromDataSchema(
    ra.GenerateFromDataSchema.Config(schema=schema, upload_datasets=True)
)

async def main():
    async with rf.Connection.from_config() as conn:
        builder = rf.WorkflowBuilder()
        builder.add(generate)          # add() returns None -- not chainable
        workflow = await builder.start(conn)
        await workflow.wait(raise_on_failure=True)
        for remote in await workflow.datasets().collect():
            ds = await remote.to_local(conn)
            print(ds.name(), ds.table.num_rows)


asyncio.run(main())
```

`Connection.from_config()` reads `~/.config/rockfish/config.toml`; `Connection.from_env()` reads `ROCKFISH_API_KEY` / `ROCKFISH_API_URL` / `ROCKFISH_PROJECT_ID` / `ROCKFISH_ORGANIZATION_ID`. The `async with` closes the HTTP session cleanly.

## Picking a domain

`domain` says how an independent or stateful column's values are produced.

| Need | Domain |
| --- | --- |
| Templated primary key tied to row position | `ID` — `IDParams(template_str="USER_{id}")` |
| Plain counter | `SEQUENTIAL_INT` |
| Guaranteed-unique key, MAC address, or IP | `UNIQUE` — `format` is `template`, `mac`, or `ipv4` |
| Per-parent child index (0, 1, 2 … within each parent) | `GROUP_ORDINAL` — count-driven children only |
| Small fixed set of choices, optionally weighted | `CATEGORICAL` |
| Realistic names, emails, addresses, SSNs, cards | `NAMED_ENTITY_PROVIDER` |
| Bounded numeric range | `UNIFORM_DIST` |
| Symmetric numeric quantity | `NORMAL_DIST` |
| Right-skewed quantity spanning orders of magnitude (latency, income, size) | `LOGNORMAL_DIST` |
| Waiting time between events | `EXPONENTIAL_DIST` |
| Multimodal column (e.g. point mass at 0 + heavy tail) | `MIXTURE` — blends other domains |
| Variable-length token sequence rendered as a string | `SEQUENCE` |
| Time-varying measurement with seasonality/noise/spikes | `TIMESERIES` — stateful only |
| Behavioral state progression | `STATE_MACHINE` — stateful only |

## Picking a derivation

`derivation` says how a derived column is computed from other columns.

| Need | Derivation |
| --- | --- |
| Total or product of numeric columns | `SUM`, `MULTIPLY` |
| Round to fixed decimals (money to cents) | `ROUND` |
| Foreign key sampled from another entity's column | `SAMPLE_FROM_COLUMN` (the only derivation allowed to reference `entity.column`) |
| Correlated FK restricted to rows matching a local value | `SAMPLE_FROM_COLUMN_WHERE` |
| Distribution that varies by another column's category | `CONDITIONAL_SAMPLE` |
| Value lookup / recode | `MAP_VALUES` |
| Row-aligned alias of one column | `COPY` |
| Running total/peak/floor within a session | `CUMULATIVE` — measurement column on a timestamped entity |
| Count or sum of a child entity rolled onto the parent | `AGGREGATE_FROM_CHILD` — takes no `dependent_columns` |
| Timestamp to epoch seconds/ms or a strftime string | `FORMAT_TIMESTAMP` |
| Timestamp plus a per-row offset column | `SHIFT_TIMESTAMP` |
| Composed string from several columns | `STRING_TEMPLATE` |
| Fixed-position substring | `SUBSTRING` |
| Luhn check digit appended to an identifier | `LUHN_APPEND` |

## Rules that cause most validation failures

- **Timestamp is all-or-nothing.** An entity has a `timestamp` **if and only if** it has at least one measurement column. If any entity has a timestamp, `DataSchema.global_timestamp` is required.
- **Category constrains type.** Independent and foreign-key columns must be `METADATA`; stateful columns must be `MEASUREMENT`; derived columns may be either.
- **Metadata cannot depend on measurement.** Metadata is generated once per entity instance, before timestamp expansion. The reverse (measurement depending on metadata) is fine.
- **Only `SAMPLE_FROM_COLUMN` crosses entities** in `dependent_columns`. Everything else must reference same-entity columns.
- **`FOREIGN_KEY` marks provenance, not a key.** It means the column carries no domain or derivation because a relationship supplies its values. Every such column must be named by some relationship where its entity is the child — either in `join_columns` (it is part of the key) or in `inherit_columns` (it is a denormalized copy from the joined parent row). Being `FOREIGN_KEY` does not make a column part of the key, so never move an inherited column into `join_columns` to satisfy this rule.
- **State machines create implicit columns.** `trigger_column_name` and every `context_variables` key become real columns; their names must not collide with any other column (including the timestamp).
- **`CategoricalParams.weights` must sum to 1.0** (unlike transition and mixture weights, which are normalized for you).

## Gotchas

- **Cardinality is instances, not rows.** For a **timeseries** entity, rows = `cardinality × ticks`, where ticks span `[t_start, t_end]` at `time_interval` (inclusive of both ends). 100 cells over 2 days at `15min` = 100 × 193 = 19,300 rows. This formula does **not** hold for state-machine entities (next bullet), and a count-driven child ignores `cardinality` entirely.
- **`TimeseriesParams.interval_minutes` should match `global_timestamp.time_interval`** — they are configured separately and a mismatch distorts the seasonal shape.
- **Timeseries entities expand densely; state-machine entities do not.** A timeseries-only entity emits one row per instance per tick. A state-machine entity places each session at a random start tick and walks consecutive ticks until a terminal state, so its rows ≈ `cardinality × mean walk length` — independent of window width. Sizing one with `cardinality × ticks` can overestimate by one or two orders of magnitude.
- **Set `seed` for anything reproducible.** Without it the server draws a fresh seed, logs it, and stamps it on each uploaded dataset as an `ent_seed` label — so a run can be reproduced after the fact.
- **`scale_factor` grows fact entities only.** Set `Entity.scale_with_factor=False` on reference/dimension entities so catalogs stay fixed as the run scales.
- **Use `decimal128(18, 2)` for money**, not `float64`, so amounts stay exact to the cent.
- **Timestamps come back as ISO 8601 *strings*, not Arrow timestamps.** Values are UTC with an explicit `+00:00` offset (`'2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00'`) whatever style `t_start`/`t_end` were written in — but the column's Arrow type is `string`, and `Timestamp(data_type=...)` does not change that. Parse before any `.dt` use: `pd.to_datetime(df["timestamp"], utc=True)`.
- **`NamedEntityProvider` uniqueness is best-effort**: pass `unique_values=N, with_replacement=False`, and note that replacement is force-enabled if rows exceed the pool.
- **This skill targets rockfish 0.79.0.** On an older SDK the newer names (`scale_factor`, the advanced `EntityRelationship` fields, `ROUND`, `SUBSTRING`, `LUHN_APPEND`, `SHIFT_TIMESTAMP`, `SAMPLE_FROM_COLUMN_WHERE`) fail at *import*, not at generation. See [Requirements](reference/schema-reference.md#requirements).
